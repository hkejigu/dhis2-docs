        allowed to manage or modify which users. To "manage a user" implies that you can
        see and modify that user. The basic concept for user management is that you can see and
        modify users which you have been granted all of the authorities; in other words you can
        modify users which have a subset of your own authorities. The managed users concept gives
        you greater control over this.</p><p>The managed users concept allows you to define which users should be able to manage which
        users. This is configured through user groups and memberships within such groups. A user
        group can be configured to be allowed to manage other user groups from the standard add and
        update user interface. The effect is that a specific user can manage all users which are
        members of user groups which can be managed by a user group that the user is member of. In
        other words, users can be managed by all members of user groups which are managing user
        groups they are member of.</p><p>To enable this concept you should grant users the authority to "Add/update users
        within managed groups", and <span class="italic">not</span> grant access to the
        standard "Add/update users" authority. An implication of the managed users concept
        is that when creating a user with the "Add/update users within managed groups"
        only, the user must be made a member of at least one user group that the current user can
        manage. If not, the current user would lose access to the user being created immediately.
        This is validated by the system.</p><p>When granted the "Add/update users within managed groups" authority, the system
        lets a user add members to user groups for which she has read-only access to. The purpose of
        this is to allow for decentralized user management. You may define a range of user groups
        where other users may add or remove members, but not remove or change the name of the
        group.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="open_id.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="mgt_user_role_group.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch04s08.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">4.6.&nbsp;Enable support for OpenID&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="dhis2_user_manual_en.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;4.8.&nbsp;Example: user
