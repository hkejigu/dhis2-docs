  <title>Localization of DHIS2</title>
 <section xml:id="localization-intro">
  <para>Localization involves the adaptation of an application to another location. When
      implementing DHIS2 in a given country, adequate resources should be allocated to translate the
      application when required. Translation of the user interface elements, messages, layout, date
      and time formats, currency and other aspects must be considered.  In addition to translation
      of the user interface itself, metadata content which is contained in the database must also be
      considered to be translated. </para>
   <para>DHIS2 supports internationalization (i18n) of the user interface through the use of Java property strings. Each
    element in the user interface has been assigned a specific key which is linked to a value. As an
    example, consider the following key/value pairs.</para>
  <programlisting>org_unit_tree=Organisation Unit Tree
error_occurred=An error has occurred.</programlisting>
  <para>In French the same key/value pairs would appear as follows</para>
  <programlisting>org_unit_tree=Arborescence des unit√©s d&apos;organisation
error_occurred=Une erreur s&apos;est produite</programlisting>
  <para>Note that the keys (text before the = symbol) are the same in both examples, but the values
    (after the = ) symbol are in each of the respective languages. Each of these key/value pairs
    would need to be translated from the original language (English) to the destination language
    (e.g. French). When the user specifies French for the user interface language, all of the
    strings would then appear in French instead of the default language (English). Any strings which
    have not been translated, would appear in English.</para>
  <para>The translation keys and values are stored in files called resource bundles. The resource
    bundles follow fallback rules, meaning that one can create a hierarchy of resource bundles
    through the file naming convention where property keys are searched from the bottom of the
    hierarchy and returned at the first match. This comes in useful when you need partial
    translations, for instance to cater for country-specific variances in a language. One example is
    Portuguese for which DHIS2 has several resource bundles:</para>
  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>i18n_global.properties (The ulimate fallback locale, which is English)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>i18n_module_pt.properties (Portuguese translations)</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>i18n_module_pt_BR.properties (Brazilian Portuguese translations)</para>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <para>This structure allows us to have a full general Portuguese translation, and a partial
    Brazilian Portuguese translation which provides translations of Brazilian-specific keys. For
    keys which are not translated in the Brazilian Portuguese resource bundle, the system will fall
    back to the general Portuguese translation. If the key is not present in that file either, the
    system will fall back to the ultimate fallback locale which is English.</para>
  <important>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>There are a number of key/value pairs such as &quot;format.FinancialApril.startDate=dd
          MMM yyyy &apos;to &apos;&quot; which are used for date/time formatting in the application.
          Part of the value should not be translated because it is actually a Java date formatting
          template. It this example it is &quot;dd MMM yyyy&quot;. Consult this <link
            xl:href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html"
            >site</link> for more information on the Java date formatting syntax. The part of the
          value which can be translated would be &quot;to&quot;, for instance to &quot;a&quot; in
          Spanish. If these data format template strings are translated, it may result in errors in
          the application. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>It is not necessary to translate a string from the original language (English) if the
          translated string is the same. You can simply leave it blank. By default, DHIS2 will use
          English values for all strings which have not been translated. </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All translated strings must be stored in escaped UTF-8 format. If you are using the
          translation portal, be sure your browser settings are set to UTF-8 when translating. If
          you are using a text editor or other tool such as an IDE, you may need to convert the
          UTF-8 characters to escaped syntax, using the Java &quot;native2ascii&quot; utility.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Some special variables (e.g. {0} ) used curly brackets. This denotes a variable which
          will be replaced by a number or other value by the application. You must place this
          variable notation in the correct position. </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </important>
    <para>There are a number of tools which can be user to support the localization of the user
      interface as well as the database content, which will be discussed below.</para>

    <title>DHIS2 i18n tool</title>
    <para>The i18n resource editor is Java desktop application which can be downloaded from
      http://www.dhis2.org/downloads . It requires that you have checked out the DHIS2 source code
      from Bazaar (check out http://www.dhis2.org/development if necessary) and have a Java Runtime
      Environment installed on your computer. On Windows, simly unpack the ZIP archvie and click the
      executable file. On Linux, extract the archive, navigate inside the extracted directory and
      invoke the following:</para>
    <screen>java -jar dhis-i18n-resourceeditor.jar</screen>
    <para/>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Press &quot;Browse&quot; when the application starts and select the path to the

          followed by OK. </para>

          that if you want to create or add to a general language translation, select e.g.
          "Portuguese - [pt]. If you want to create a country-specific translation, select e.g.
          "Portuguese - Brazil [pt_BR]. Locales which already have keys translated will show the
          text "Resources for this locale exist".</para>

    <title>Using the DHIS2 translation server</title>
    <para>A web-based portal solution has been setup in order to facilitate the translation of DHIS
      2 into multiple languages. Simply direct your browser to http://translate.dhis2.net/ and
      register for an account by providing a username, email address and password. The server will
      send you a confirmation email which you can use to activate your account. Once you have
      activated your account, simply press the &quot;Log in&quot; link from the main portal page,
      and provide your username and password. </para>
    <para>The first time you login, you should select your settings, by clicking &quot;My
      account-&gt;Settings&quot;. Here you can select your interface language, the projects which
      you wish to work on, and the languages which you will translate into. Be sure to press
      &quot;Save&quot; when have finished making your changes. </para>
    <para>To start translating, be sure you have logged in, and then press the &quot;Home&quot; link
      in the upper-right hand corner. Select a project (e.g. DHIS2) and then click on the language
      which you wish to translate. The number of words which need to be translated will be displayed
      under the &quot;Summary&quot; field. Click on one of the modules (e.g. dhis-2) and the keep
      drilling down through the folders to find a module which needs translation, (e.g.
      dhis-web-&gt;dhis-web-caseentry). Now click on the &quot;Summary&quot; text which will say
      something like &quot;194 words need attention&quot;. You will be directed to the string which
      requires translation. </para>

  <section xml:id="translations-app">
    <title>Database translation app</title>
    <para>In addition to translation of the user interface, DHIS2 also supports the localization of
      the metadata content in the database. It is possible to translate individual objects through
      the maintenance app, but in order to better support a standard translation workflow, a
      specialized app has been developed for this purpose. The DHIS2 translation app can be used to
      translate all metadata (data elements, categories, organisation units, etc) into any locale
      which is present in the database. </para>
    <para>To get started, simply choose the "Translations" app from the top level menu. </para>
